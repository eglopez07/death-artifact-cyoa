# Death Artifacts: a choose-your-own-adventure game

A choose-your-own-adventure game inspired by the theme of "death", this was a game I made in 24 hours for a game jam in late 2017. It's very basic since I was not experienced in working with Twine, and served more as a learning experience than anything else.

I have uploaded the .html file that allows you to play through the game in your web browser. I recommend Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. The .html file is in the state it was in after the game jam had ended; it is only 50% complete as far as I am concerned. There is technically a "win" state, but I had planned to add more paths and more options. Perhaps someday I will go back to complete the game, but for now I just want to leave this up for archival purposes.

The game is free to download and to modify as one wishes. The program used to make this game, Twine, can be acquired at http://twinery.org/ and you can use it to import the game and mess around with it.
